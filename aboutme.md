I am a NLP Data Scientist for Amazon Web Services World Wide Public Sector. As mentioned in my job title, I work primarily on NLP tasks for majority of my Data Science career. Projects that I've worked on ranges from simple classification and named entity recognition to information retrieval and custom deep learning work. State-of-the-art works such as transformer models are exciting but I find more algorithmic approaches to Data Science more fascinating. Interested to see where the field of NLP, and ML in general, would go in the next few years. I'm also a OMSCS student under Georgia Tech with an ML specialization expecting to graduate by Spring of 2022.
