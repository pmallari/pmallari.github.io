excerpt: Some of my thoughts on forking this website.

In all honesty, I thought this website was cool and I could fork it to start writing posts about my thoughts and things that I found interesting. I don't really expect people to come visit this website and that's fine. I'm mainly starting this website to share my thoughts on certain topics or classes that I thought was interesting to the few who accidentally come across this post, or for future Prince to look back and cringe at my thought process. Maybe I accidentally write a useful analysis of a class discussion or paper that might help that one person who's on the 3rd page of the Google search. But to whoever comes across this website, hope you have fun looking around and that you found something interesting or useful. I'm still studying and learning more about ML and NLP and I'm slowly enjoying the field.

If you're curious on what I plan to work tackle, there are some books that I plan to write notes or codes for. Things on my list are the following:

- An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R (planning to write a Python version for this)
- Notes on the Stanford CS224N lecture videos and paper readings
- Some NLP papers that I found interesting (I'm looking at you Byte Pair Encoding paper)
